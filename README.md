# Starbuccaneer

Programmatically login to Starbucks Wifi in Japan using Puppeteer and Node.

Just run,

```
npx starbuccaneer@latest
```

and then leave it running. It will attempt to log you in once every minute.

Alternatively, you can install the tool globally with `npm i --location=global starbuccaneer`, and then run it with `starbuccaneer` on the command line.
