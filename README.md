# Starbuccaneer

Work in progress.

Programmatically login to Starbucks Wifi in Japan using Puppeteer and Node.

I haven't confirmed that this works yet.

## Install

Run `npm i` to install the necessary modules.

After attempting to run it with `npm run start`, if you get an error related to Chrome not being installed, from the `starbuccaneer/node_modules/puppeteer` folder, run `npm run install`.
